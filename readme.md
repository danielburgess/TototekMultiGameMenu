#Tototek Multi-Game Menu
I've traced the full code for the Tototek SUPER-FLASH multi game menu (tiny).

This can be used to create custom menus based on this device. 

At some point I want to dump data contained on the Xilinx CPLD that is soldered to the pcb in order to figure out how it works and possibly create a custom version for my Super Famicade project.

Compiles with xkas 0.06. Currently has bugs that I'm working through. Might be a typo somewhere...
