# Tototek Multi-Game Menu
I've traced and re-written the full code for the Tototek SUPER-FLASH multi game menu (tiny).

This can be used to create custom menus based on this device. 

At some point I want to dump data contained on the Xilinx CPLD that is soldered to the pcb in order to figure out how it works and possibly create a custom version for my Super Famicade project.

NOTE:
NO LONGER ASSEMBLES WITH XKAS 0.06. (Now using bass v14 as the assembler.)

Fixed all issues. Code should work identically to the original.

You could technically re-locate everything in the code to the original program counter locations and it would be exact (...if you're worried about final file size.)
