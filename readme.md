#Tototek Multi-Game Menu
I've traced the full code for the Tototek SUPER-FLASH multi game menu.

This can be used to create custom menus based on this device. 

At some point I want to dump data contained on the Xilinx CPLD that is soldered to the pcb in order to figure out how it works and possibly create a custom version for my Super Famicade project.

For now, I need to clean this up some more before it'll compile. But once I do, it'll compile with xkas 0.06.
